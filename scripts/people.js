His work stems from research into the liminal: from suppressed historical narratives, to popular mythologies, and to the far-reaching registers on the electro-magnetic spectrum. Coming out of New York’s Lower East Side music scene of the 90s, Farrow’s work also questions the narrative of expertise; with nearly every project, he embarks on learning a new skill set in order to disrupt viewer expectations as well as his own. For Farrow, this practice is both political and metaphysical. He has shown and presented work in New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Sweden, United Kingdom, Kuwait, and has had two solo exhibits in the United Arab Emirates. From 2011-2016 he produced The Distract and Disable Program broadcast on WGXC 90.7 FM in Hudson, NY, and his music and sound works have been released by Hello CD, free103point9, and Must Die Records. Along with an MA in music, he holds an MFA in Studio Art from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and currently teaches Visual Arts and Interactive Media courses at New York University Abu Dhabi.","SubsectionLink":"https://www.jonnyfarrow.net/","SubsectionCourses":"Circuit Breakers!, Foundations of 3D, Print Studio 1, Sound Art, Grad Seminar"},{"SubsectionStatus":"Visible","SubsectionType":"Faculty","SubsectionOrder":"5","SubsectionImage":"google-drive-faculty-link-5 or dreamhost/faculty5.jpg","SubsectionName":"Sarah Fay Krom","SubsectionTitle":"Assistant Professor of Practice of Interactive Media","SubsectionEmail":"sfk3@nyu.edu","SubsectionBio":"Sarah Fay Krom is an Assistant Professor of Practice of Interactive Media in the Division of Arts & Humanities at New York University Abu Dhabi.

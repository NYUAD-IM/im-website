In this world, civilization has been reduced to living under a protective dome, with water sprinkler units protecting its outside perimeters. Placed in the midst of a catastrophe – where one of the sprinklers has malfunctioned and wild fire approaches the city – it is the user’s role to use their powers (in the form of magical projectiles) to extinguish the flames and fix the sprinkler. This activity reflects an alternate world activity as it is an everyday action for the firefighter/protector in this world, yet which is in a setting that is quite distinct from the reality we know.","SubsectionAuthors":[{"AuthorName":"Steven Wyks","AuthorPortfolio":"http://stevenwyks.com/"},{"AuthorName":"Will Mlekush","AuthorPortfolio":""},{"AuthorName":"Mari Calderon","AuthorPortfolio":"https://maricalderon.net/work"}]},{"SubsectionStatus":"Visible","SubsectionType":"Project","SubsectionOrder":"3","SubsectionImage":"google-drive-project-link-3 or dreamhost/project3.jpg","SubsectionProjectName":"Musical Stairs","SubsectionAuthor":"Maria Paula Calderon","SubsectionPortfolio":"https://maricalderon.net/work","SubsectionProjectLink":"https://maricalderon.net/musical-stairs-an-interactive-installation","SubsectionProjectTerm":"Fall 2019","SubsectionProjectClass":"Sensors, Body, and Motion","SubsectionProjectDescription":"Musical Stairs enhances the experience of taking the stairs in the NYUAD Arts Center through spontaneous and collaborative music-creation.
